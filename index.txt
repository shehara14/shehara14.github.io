About me

 I am a third-year undergraduate at the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT), pursuing a BSc (Hons) in Information Technology with a strong interest in UI/UX Design, Web Design, and Quality Assurance. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in front-end development, user-centered design principles, and modern testing practices.

Through various university projects, I have gained hands-on experience in designing user-friendly interfaces, developing responsive web applications, and conducting both manual and automated testing. I'm passionate about creating smooth, accessible digital experiences and continuously improving through real-world exposure. I am now seeking opportunities to apply my skills, contribute to innovative solutions, and grow professionally in the tech industry.
